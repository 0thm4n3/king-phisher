## Code Documentation
King Phisher uses Sphinx for internal code documentation. This
documentation can be generated from source with the command
```sphinx-build docs/source docs/build```. The latest documentation is
kindly hosted on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/) at
[king-phisher.readthedocs.org](https://king-phisher.readthedocs.org/en/latest/).

## Client Configuration
The client configuration file is encoded in JSON and most options are
configurable through the GUI interface.

The following options will be honored but are not configurable through
the GUI:

* mailer.max_messages_per_connection (Default: 5)
* ssh_preferred_key (Default: N/A)

### Message Template Variables
The client message templates are formatted using the Jinja2 templating engine
and support a number of variables. These are included here as a reference, check
the templates [wiki page](https://github.com/securestate/king-phisher/wiki/Templates)
for comprehensive documentation.

Variable Name              | Variable Value
---------------------------|---------------
client.company\_name       | The target's company name
client.email\_address      | The target's email address
client.first\_name         | The target's first name
client.last\_name          | The target's last name
client.message_id          | The unique tracking identifier (this is the same as uid)
url.tracking\_dot          | URL of an image used for message tracking
url.webserver              | Phishing server URL with the uid parameter
url.webserver_raw          | Phishing server URL without any parameters
tracking\_dot\_image\_tag  | The tracking image in a preformatted ```<img />``` tag
uid                        | The unique tracking identifier (this is the same as client.message_id)

The uid is the most important, and must be present in links that the messages
contain.
