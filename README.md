### Message Template Variables
The client message template supports a number of variables each begining with $.

* $webserver\_url (Phishing Site URL example: &lt;a href="$webserver\_url?id=$uid"&gt;)
* $uid (Tracking User ID)

* $last\_name (Last Name)

The $webserver\_url and $uid variables are the most important and must be present in messages which are sent.
