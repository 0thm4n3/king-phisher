Plugins
=======

Starting with version :release:`1.3.0` King Phisher includes a plugin system. At
this time only client plugins are supported with server side plugins slated for
a future release. The common functionality for the two is provided by the
:py:mod:`plugins` module and then extended by the respective implementation.
