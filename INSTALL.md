Before getting started, install all of the required packages specified below.

## Overview
King-Phisher uses a client server architecture.  The ```KingPhisherServer``` file runs as a daemon on the phishing server.  The ```KingPhisher``` client file is meant to connect to the daemon over SSH. The server must be running SSH and allow ports to be forwarded. The client, after connecting communicates via RPC to the server through the encrypted SSH tunnel.

Additionally, the user logging in with the King-Phisher client will require a valid local account on the KingPhisherServer.
